## tl;dr

WebSockets are like a phone conversation. Traditional HTTP is like a radio.

## What is a WebSocket?

<div>
  <Image
    align="left"
    src={Telephone}
    width="200"
    style={{ marginRight: '2rem' }}
  />
  <p>
    A WebSocket connection is like a telephone. Both the client and the server
    can freely send messages back and forth over a single connection TCP.
  </p>
</div>
<div>

</div>

<div>
  <Image
    align="left"
    src={WalkieTalkies}
    width="200"
    style={{ marginRight: '2rem' }}
  />
  <p>
    A traditional http POST, GET, etc. is like a walkie-talkie. The server will
    only respond to a client's message, they cannot freely send messages back
    and forth.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example we're using the proper way to talk on a walkie-talkie, i.e.
    after the other person has finished talking with "over".
  </p>
  <p>
    An HTTP request also has to create a new connection each time. While this
    isn't a big deal for a single request, it can be a problem if you're making
    a lot of them.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <Image
    align="left"
    src={LoudSpeaker}
    width="200"
    style={{ marginRight: '2rem' }}
  />
  <p>
    A WebSocket server can also broadcast messages to all connected clients. Not
    limited to the 1-1 relationship of a traditional http request. This is where
    the metaphore falls apart. In this sense, a WebSocket is more like a loud
    speaker.
